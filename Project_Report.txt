Submission Type: Technical Documentation / Final Project Report

Project Status: 100% Production-Ready (V1.0)

1. ABSTRACT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ob AI Sentinel is an advanced, enterprise-grade security platform that integrates 
Computer Vision (CV) with modern web technologies to automate physical threat 
detection. Traditional surveillance systems rely heavily on manual monitoring, 
which is error-prone and labor-intensive. Ob AI Sentinel addresses this challenge 
by using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) deep learning model to detect weapons 
(firearms, knives) and suspicious activity in real-time, instantly notifying 
administrators and logging critical forensic evidence. The system features a 
microservices-ready backend, a defense-in-depth security architecture, and a 
high-performance frontend tailored for Security Operations Centers (SOCs).

2. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Problem Statement
Manual video surveillance is inherently inefficient. Studies show that human 
attention degrades significantly after just 20 minutes of monitoring video feeds, 
leading to missed security events. Furthermore, post-incident forensic analysis 
often requires sifting through hours of footage manually.

2.2 Proposed Solution
Ob AI Sentinel automates this process using AI. It ingests video feeds or static 
images, processes them through a neural network trained on thousands of threat 
objects, and provides instant visual and extensive data-driven alerts. This changes 
the security paradigm from reactive (investigating after an event) to proactive 
(identifying threats as they appear).

2.3 Technology Scope
The project encapsulates full-stack development, AI model integration, database 
management, and cybersecurity engineering. It demonstrates proficiency in Python 
(data engineering/backend), React (interactive frontend), and DevOps practices.

3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The application utilizes a modular, layered architecture designed for scalability 
and maintainability.

3.1 Frontend Layer (Client-Side)
   - **Framework:** React 18 (Single Page Application).
   - **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with a custom "Cyber-Dark" design system.
   - **Animations:** Framer Motion (layout transitions) & GSAP (timeline animations).
   - **UI Library:** Radix UI primitives for accessible, unstyled components.
   - **Routing:** React Router v6 with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) guards.

3.2 Backend Layer (Server-Side)
   - **API Framework:** FastAPI (Python 3.11+), chosen for its asynchronous 
     capabilities and automatic OpenAPI documentation.
   - **Database ORM:** SQLAlchemy 2.0 (Async) managing PostgreSQL relationships.
   - **Validation:** Pydantic V2 schemas for strict request/response validation.
   - **Task Queue:** Celery with Redis for offloading heavy video processing tasks 
     to background workers, ensuring the API remains responsive.
   - **Email Service:** `aiosmtplib` with Jinja2 templating for transactional emails.

3.3 AI Inference Engine
   The system employs a **Hybrid Dual-Engine** approach for maximum flexibility and accuracy:
   
   - **Primary Engine (Cloud):** **Roboflow API**.
     - Utilization of hosted inference endpoints for superior accuracy on specific threat classes.
     - Supports multi-model ensembles (e.g., separate models for weapons, persons, and vehicles).
   - **Secondary Engine (Local Fallback):** **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)**.
     - On-premise execution using `best.pt` weights.
     - Ensures system functionality even during internet outages or air-gapped deployments.
   
   **Pipeline:**
     1. Image/Frame Intake.
     2. Pre-processing (Resize/Normalization).
     3. **Smart Routing:** Checks for API availability; routes to Roboflow if online, falls back to local YOLOv8 if offline.
     4. Post-processing (Non-Maximum Suppression) to filter overlapping boxes.
     5. Threat Classification (Dangerous vs. Caution vs. Harmless).

4. DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION & FEATURES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 Security Engineering (Defense-in-Depth)
   Ob AI Sentinel treats security as a first-class citizen, not an add-on.

   - **Password Security:** Argon2id hashing algorithm (memory-hard) prevents 
     GPU-based brute-force attacks.
   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
     1. **Time-based OTP (TOTP):** Integration with Google Authenticator.
     2. **Email OTP:** Secure 6-digit backup codes sent via SMTP.
   - **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM encryption for storing sensitive secrets 
     (like MFA seeds) at rest in the database.
   - **Rate Limiting:** Redis-backed rate limiter (using SlowAPI) protects API 
     endpoints from DDoS and brute-force attempts.
     - *Standard:* 60 req/min.
     - *Strict:* 5 req/min (Login endpoints).
   - **Session Management:** Stateless JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with short-lived 
     access tokens and rotating refresh tokens to prevent replay attacks.

4.2 Object Detection & Threat Logic
   The core AI service classifies detections into specific threat tiers:
   
   - **🔴 DANGEROUS:** Firearms (pistol, rifle), Knives, Explosives. 
     *Action:* Immediate Alert, Red Bounding Box, Admin Notification.
   - **🟡 CAUTION:** Suspicious Persons, Backpacks left unattended. 
     *Action:* Warning Log, Yellow Bounding Box.
   - **🟢 HARMLESS:** General objects (tables, chairs). 
     *Action:* Standard Logging, Green Bounding Box.

4.3 User Management & Administration
   - **RBAC:** Detailed `User` vs `Admin` permission capabilities.
   - **Forensics Dashboard:** Admin panel to review "Alert Logs", see timestamps, confidence scores, and evidentiary images.
   - **Audit Logging:** Immutable logs track every user action (Login, Upload, Delete) for compliance.

4.4 Asynchronous Processing
   To handle large video files without blocking the server:
   - Videos are uploaded to local storage or AWS S3.
   - A Celery task is dispatched to the Redis queue.
   - The worker process picks up the task, splits the video into frames, runs detection on every Nth frame, and recompiles the result.
   - The user is notified via WebSocket or polling when processing is complete.

5. RESULTS & PERFORMANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Accuracy:** The YOLOv8 model achieves high mAP (mean Average Precision) on 
  tested datasets, reliably detecting weapons in various lighting conditions.
- **Latency:** Single image inference averages <100ms on standard CPUs, and <15ms 
  on supported GPUs.
- **Scalability:** The containerized backend (Docker) allows for horizontal scaling 
  of worker nodes to handle increased video processing loads.

6. CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ob AI Sentinel successfully bridges the gap between theoretical AI models and 
practical security applications. By wrapping a powerful object detection engine 
in a secure, enterprise-ready web application, it provides a viable solution for 
modern physical security challenges. The project demonstrates a comprehensive 
understanding of full-stack development, from designing responsive frontends to 
architecting secure, asynchronous backends and integrating complex AI pipelines.
